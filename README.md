# The Dangling Traveler

### What is this?

You are planning a trip, but are not sure what to do exactly when you get to your destination? The Dangling Traveler, from The Dangling Pointers team ([Shivangi Pattnaik], [Long Tran] and [Tony Bach], is here to help you out. Simply choose the city (or cities) that you are visiting, and we will show you the top ranked restaurants and attractions in that city, according to Yelp users. Furthermore, you can specify what kind of restaurants you want to dine at (Japanese, Thai, Greek etc...) or what kind of attractions you want to visit (theaters, parks, landmarks etc...), and our app will show you on that city's map where exactly they are, along with other useful information such as address, phone number, snippet of a user review, and so on.

Of course it is not very convenient to have to open our app every time you want to see what the options are. Therefore, we have provided you with the option to save your choices as a PDF, or print out all the information directly. 

So what are you waiting for? Plan your trip with The Dangling Traveler, then pack your bags and go!

### Technical stuffs

This app could not have been possible without the use of: 

- [jQuery Map Marker Plugin] to mark where the restaurants/attractions are on the map
- [Yelp] database
- [SweetAlert] for the sweet alerts
- [FileSaver.js], which allows saving the Preferences page as XHTML.
