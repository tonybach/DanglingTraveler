{"name":"The Dangling Traveler","tagline":"Simple Trip Planning App","body":"# The Dangling Traveler\r\n\r\n### What is this?\r\n\r\nYou are planning a trip, but are not sure what to do exactly when you get to your destination? Our app is here to help you out. Simply choose the city (or cities) that you are visiting, and we will show you the top ranked restaurants and attractions in that city, according to Yelp users. Furthermore, you can specify what kind of restaurants you want to dine at (Japanese, Thai, Greek etc...) or what kind of attractions you want to visit (theaters, parks, landmarks etc...), and our app will show you on that city's map where exactly they are, along with other useful information such as address, phone number, snippet of a user review, and so on.\r\n\r\nOf course it is not very convenient to have to open our app every time you want to see what the options are. Therefore, we have provided you with the option to save your choices as a PDF, or print out all the information directly. \r\n\r\nSo what are you waiting for? Plan your trip with The Dangling Traveler, then pack your bags and go!\r\n\r\n### Technical stuffs\r\n\r\nThis app could not have been possible without the use of: \r\n\r\n- [jQuery Map Marker Plugin] to mark where the restaurants/attractions are on the map\r\n- [Yelp] database\r\n\r\n### Sounds good! How do I start?\r\n\r\n1. Clone this repository.\r\n2. Open a command prompt and navigate to the directory to where you cloned the repository to.\r\n3. In the command prompt, type 'npm install'.\r\n4. After that is done, type 'node server.js'.\r\n5. Open a web browser and go to 'localhost:8080'.\r\n6. That's it!\r\n \r\n[jQuery Map Marker Plugin]: https://github.com/aslamdoctor/jQuery.mapmarker\r\n[Yelp]: http://www.yelp.com\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-64310162-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
